This is a React project which consist of an authentication page and a dashboard screen, clients data was populated with api from the backend. On logging in, one can view the data for the Users by clicking the Users link on the side navigation. The users view displays information about all the users with different their status. onclick of the view more icon at the far right on each user, more information can be retrieved on that user.

This is a project built with React and TypeScript, it was styled using SASS, Bootsrap and Ant Design. Routing was handled using react router dom.

During the course of this project, I had a bit of an issue with nested routing as it applies to this current project, I also had challenges with authntication, I couldn`t easily decide which method I wanted to use.

For people who want to clone and run this project locally, you could do that by running the git clone command, adding the project link in front of the command. Once cloned, do not forget to run npm install in order to install the neccessary dependencies the project runs on.
